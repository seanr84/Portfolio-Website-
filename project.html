            <img src="./images/scrollingShooter.png" alt="Scrolling Shooter Game">
            <p>A scrolling shooter gamme that I made developed in one of game development courses that I took. The goal is to move around and shoot enemy planes to increase the score.</p>

            <p>This platform game allows the player to move around on different platforms to finish the level by going to the level sign to advance or win the game.</p>
            <p>The player can destroy enemies by jumping on top of them to gain points, however the player will loose a life that are on the top right if they get hit by one.</p>
            <p>There are other aspects to notice such as the vines that the player can climb up and down on, and the mushrooms that give the player an extra life.</p>
